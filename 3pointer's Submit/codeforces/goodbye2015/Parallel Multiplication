Algorithm Polynomial multiplication (Parallel Computation function)

INPUT: A prime polynomial a(z) of degree at most m-1
       A prime polynomial b(z) of degree at most n-1

OUTPUT: c(z) = a(z) * b(z)

	1.Initialize n+m Parallel Computing Units for c numbers from 0 to n+m-1
	2.copy a (numbers from 0 to m-1) into parallel computing resource
	        a[j] (j from 0 to m-1)
          copy b (numbers from 0 to n-1) into parallel computing resource
	        b[i] (i from 0 to n-1)
	3.For each computing unit:
		c[i+j] <- (a[i] * b[j] + c[i+j])

	4.Return(c)
